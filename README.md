# Mesh Generation
This program is written to do the following:
1- Read a list of 3D points from input in a given text file. The points are assumed to be obtained as the result of a non-uniform sampling from a grayscale image. 
2- Generate the 2D Delaunay triangulation of the given points.
3- Rasterize the mesh and output the reconstructed image.
For further details please refer to the description included in file "make_mesh.cpp"
